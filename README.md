# GPS-Route-Tracker
This project visualizes GPS route data using Python and GMPlot. It processes GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) from a CSV file and plots the route on a Google Map. The map is then saved as an HTML file, allowing for easy visualization of the route. Simple, interactive, and effective!
